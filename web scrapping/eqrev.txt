1. Data Engineer Role (Simplified)

A Data Engineer’s core responsibility is to collect, process, and store data so that it can be used for analytics, dashboards, or automation.

For your Amazon example:

Extract / Collect Data

Pull data from Amazon Seller API or scrape using Selenium (small-scale / public data)

Can also be other sources (Shopify, Flipkart, internal DBs, logs, files)

Transform / Clean Data

Small clients: Clean in Python (ETL)

Remove invalid prices, normalize product names, calculate derived fields

Large clients: Store raw data first (ELT) in a warehouse like BigQuery, Redshift

Transform via SQL queries or tools like dbt

Keeps raw data for auditing or reprocessing

Load Data

Small: Store in MySQL or PostgreSQL

Large: Store in cloud warehouse (BigQuery / Redshift / Snowflake)

Schedule / Automate

Run pipeline automatically every 30–45 minutes (or configurable)

Can use Python scripts with schedulers, cron jobs, or Airflow for orchestration

Provide Usable Output

Create dashboards, reports, or tables for the client

Example: show valid product prices, inventory levels, ad performance

2. Your Program vs Real-World Pipeline
Aspect	Your Program	Real Data Engineer Pipeline
Data Source	Scrapes Amazon HTML	API or official feeds (secure, multi-client)
Scale	Small dataset	Large-scale, multiple clients, multiple platforms
Transform	Python cleaning	ETL (Python) or ELT (SQL in warehouse)
Storage	MySQL	MySQL / BigQuery / Redshift / Snowflake
Frequency	Manual / single run	Automated, 12–15 times/day, or every 30–45 min
Multi-client	Not handled	Tokens, client_id, separate tables, secure storage
Output	Query in SQL	Dashboards, reports, alerts, analytics

✅ Conclusion: Your program is enough for small-scale learning or small clients, but for enterprise clients, pipelines include automation, scheduling, multi-client support, secure token handling, and cloud warehouses.

3. Interview-Ready Summary

“A Data Engineer collects data from sources like APIs or websites, transforms it (either in Python or inside a warehouse), stores it in a database, and schedules automated pipelines. For small-scale clients, ETL pipelines in Python + MySQL are enough. For large clients, ELT pipelines store raw data in a warehouse and run SQL transformations to produce analytics dashboards, often running multiple times a day.”
